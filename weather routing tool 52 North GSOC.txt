Installation section observations (WeatherRoutingTool):

1. Installation steps and commands are clearly listed and technically correct.

2. However, there is no clear guidance on what to do after installation is complete.

3. Beginners may not know how to verify a successful installation or how to run the tool for the first time.

4. The purpose of the command using `requirements-without-deps.txt` may be unclear to new contributors.

5. The power/fuel consumption framework section mentions additional setup but does not clarify
whether it is required for a first run or only for advanced use cases.
